# Hello 👋

My name is Remco. I’m an open source software developer from the Netherlands.

I’m mostly interested in JavaScript, TypeScript, and developer tooling. I maintain most of my projects [on GitHub](https://github.com/remcohaszing), but I also maintain a couple [on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/remcohaszing). If you like my work, consider sponsoring me via [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/remcohaszing).

I also like metal, Nintendo, table top RPGs, and cats. 🐱
